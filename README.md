## Hey, I'm Cam. Thanks for stopping by.
I'm a driven, passionate, and relentlessly curious recent graduate from UNH, with way more free time than I'd really prefer right now! 

Currently I fill my days learning new tech, working on projects that excite me, and spending time with my family. 

I'm looking for entry-level software development roles in and around New Hampshire, so please feel free to reach out, I always love to chat!
